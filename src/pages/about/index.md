I have been extremely active since a young age. Growing up in Canada you can say I was born on skates and skis. I became a personal trainer because I am extremely passionate about food and exercise and truly believe it to be life changing. I want to help you be the best version of yourself that you can be with dynamic training regimes, diets and advice tailored to your body and mind. At the end of the day my goal is to help you feel as good as you possibly can.
